Goal
----
An experimental code to prove the power of a new method in computational geometry.
Topology oriented method and 4D Conformal model(Geometic Algebra).

Issue
-----
Topology oriented method by Sugiura had released us from troubles
    which caused by numerical computation error.

However, we still need further:
1. Remains branching whether a voronoi region is bounded or unbounded
2. It forces us to limit boundary where diagram is posed by 3 initial points.

My work
-------
I have an idea that 4D conformal model solve above 2 issues by:
- Infinity point expression
- Generic intersection formula
